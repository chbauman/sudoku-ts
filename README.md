# Sudoku-js

A game of sudoku written in Javascript as a mobile app.
Let's you solve the hardest sudokus by hand!

It allows you to guess a number and continue solving while being able to 
return to the point of guessing. This process can be done in a nested way.

Can you solve this one? It was [devised by Arto Inkala, a Finnish mathematician, 
and is specifically designed to be unsolvable to all but the sharpest minds.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/9359579/Worlds-hardest-sudoku-can-you-crack-it.html)
